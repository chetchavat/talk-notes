A chart should read like a paragraph of copy

Details matter!
- label things consistently
- make the text fit and not overlap
- format axes

two data science avenues
- machine learning deep diving
- "functional" strategy and analytics
    - provide value fast
    - domain driven data science

a lot of specialization in DS now, compared to days of yore
    - more traditional DS should be ML Engineer

data science (title) is becoming obsolete because generalists are:
- no longer needed
- are all taken
- are senior engineers

useful data visualization
- data viz changes when you have words
- you want to lead into data viz rather than have data viz be standalone
    - don't have people derive their own "insights" from standalone viz
- interactivity is really nice
- "is this really useful?"
