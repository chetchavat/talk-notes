Excerpted from and email I sent recently to someone wanting to enter Data from Accounting:

I do read a few blogs and newsletters, and I have quite a few bookmarked:
- [Technically](https://technically.substack.com)- explains technical concepts in a straightforward way
- [Counting Stuff](https://counting.substack.com) - a little rambly, but good insight into the things that data analysts (and scientists) think about
- [Locally Optimistic](locallyoptimistic.com) - a blog about data teams and organizations, reading this helped me shape my thoughts as a manager
- [Normcore Tech](https://vicki.substack.com) - this is more general writing on tech, but the writer is a Data Science practitioner, so there is a data perspective to many articles
- [Caitlin Hudon](https://mobile.twitter.com/beeonaposy) - Caitlin works in data in Austin. She has a really good twitter account and blog.
- [Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/posts/) - a lot of example problems explained in R
- [Emile's Data Canon](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2013122) - this one is pretty recent, but someone on twitter asked what some "seminal" blog posts in analytics were, and Emile put together a pretty good list
- [Multithreaded](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/) - Stitch Fix's data blog, it's about as futuristic and innovative as you can get outside of Google
- [Practical advice for analysis of large, complex data sets](http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2016/10/practical-advice-for-analysis-of-large.html?m=1) - pretty straightforward here

Some books that I have read or are commonly recommended:
- [ISLR](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) - a pretty seminal stats textbook that also teaches you R
- [Data Smart](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Data+Smart%3A+Using+Data+Science+to+Transform+Information+into+Insight-p-9781118661468) - an interesting book that teaches you some basic ML algorithms in excel, and then gives you a primer on R at the end. It's a good illustration on how these algorithms work that is more approachable than code or math.
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - a good introduction to data analysis in R

Funnily enough, most of the stuff I sent you is about R, even though my day to day is using Python and SQL. 
If you want to learn SQL, here are some good tutorials:
- [Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/)
- [Select Star SQL](https://selectstarsql.com/) - an interactive book for SQL
