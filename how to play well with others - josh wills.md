## infinite loop of sadness
- a result of data functions being spread out
    - data eng in eng
    - analytics teams in business teams
    - an ops data team
    - a business data team
- a business wants answers to their questions
    - they hire data scientists
        - DS wants to impress other DS at DS cons through ML
        - DS wants a Data Engineering team for modeling
    - they hire data engineers
        - who wants to impress people by building cutting edge data pipelines
        - need machines to do modeling, and go to the ops team
    - the ops team provisions and sends the bill to the business
    - the business is confused because there isn't the answer to any questions
        - so they decide they need to hire more data scientists

## what is the data team’s vision?
- what is my team’s vision?
- work toward providing value for the business
- data unifying goal: help people make better decisions

## SRE principles
- ask bill/ross/joshua/jason about SRE principles
- SLOs/OKRs
    - can't have SRE/DS without SLOs/OKRs
    - display commitment to improving process
- Automation and Experience
    - Design automation with a target audience in mind
        - If it requires an SRE to use automation, the automation isn't good enough
        - If it requies a DS to create experiements, your experiments platform isn't good enough
        - If it requires an analyst to read a dashboard, your dashboard isn't good enough

## going corporate
    - if you love data, that doesn't make you a great DS leader, it makes you a good first line manager for a data team
        - if you want to be a great DS leader, you have to learn to play well   with other teams
            - the higher you go, the harder it gets
    - once you build a data team, your first team is managing your manager peers
    - the data team needs that advocacy

## hard truths

### the map is not the territory
- maps tell you at a high level the area
- the territory is the nuance, nook, and cranny
- dashboards are a map
- avoid ignoring people's lived experience and anecdotes

### when things are going well, no one cares about the data
- why should you care about data?
- everything falls apart
    - snapchat
        - things were going so well for so long, that they did not care about data
        - facebook did, targeted them, and destroyed them
            - and that's why we care about data

### when things fall apart, people care about data
- how to prepare for things fall apart?
    - pre-mortems
        - measure the stuff people are worried about 
            - what would happen if everything went wrong?
            - why would users fall? why would store not succeed?
        - focus on measuring the bad things is helpful for stakeholders

### look for business that are decomposable
- google
    - search: get people to search more
    - ads: make more money per search
- facebook
    - growth: get more DAUs
    - core: get more mins spent per DAU
    - ads: get more $ per mins spend

## synthesize qualitative and quantitative data 
- astroball - ben reiter
- annie duke again, don't focus on resulting


## organized anarchy
- Cohen, March, and Olsen: A Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice
- 3 general properties
    - problematic preferences
        - it is difficult to impute a set of preferences to to the decision situation that satisfies the standard consistency requirements for a theory of choice
        - it operates on the basis of inconsistent and ill-defined preferences
        - it discovers preferences through actions more than acting on the basis of preferences
    - unclear technology
        - it's processes are unclear it its members
        - it operates on the basis of simple trial and error procedure, learning from the accidents of the past, and pragmatic inventions of necessity
    - fluid participation
        - participants vary in the amount of time they devote to different domains

## solutions in seach of problems
- timing is everything
- the right time to present data is when things are starting to go bad
