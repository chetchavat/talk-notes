## Intro
It's wild to have an idea for a talk and find one that basically covers all the points.


Working a lot in a ad-hoc basis, they found that data comms became a pretty big problem for them.

## Everyone should be speaking the same language
Not SQL vs Python, but speaking to each other about data with a shared understanding about the definitions.

## Three Barriers
- Stakeholder involvement
    - getting the correct people involved in the naming and definition process
- Engineering implementation
    - the metr
- Discoverability
    - once data has been defined and implemented, anyone in the company can find them

Need to overcome all three barriers to achieve effective communications

## Stakeholder involvement

## Scaling the process
Scaling engineering is easy, but scaling people is hard
- Stakeholder involvement
    - defining MAU
        - suggested logged in in the past 30 days
        - brought it to people, and folks agreed
            - but were they the right folks? or the folks that the team worked well with
        - sanity check with broader group
            - broader group was not a fan, wanted a more specific definiton
    - make sure you're talking to the right people, but also imo, have sanity checks
- Discoverability
    - Problem: Google doc went from a few pages to 10+
    - Current Solution: 
        - use Google doc for high level things and commonly used words
        - dbt docs for more granular things
            - trying out exposures too
        - write contextual definitions on dashboards 
            - can link back to gdoc or dbt docs
    - really, always be interating, this is a hard problem that isn't solved

## broad lessons learned
- in the end aim for good enough
- if there isn't anyone pushing back on stuff, you might not have the right people selected
- if someone just says good enough, they may be too far from the problem
- they have created a process that is focused on overcoming the three barriers
