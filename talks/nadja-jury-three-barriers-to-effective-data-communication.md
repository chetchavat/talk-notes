## Intro
It's wild to have an idea for a talk and find one that basically covers all the points.


Working a lot in a ad-hoc basis, they found that data comms became a pretty big problem for them.

## Everyone should be speaking the same language
Not SQL vs Python, but speaking to each other about data with a shared understanding about the definitions.

## Three Barriers
- Stakeholder involvement
    - getting the correct people involved in the naming and definition process
- Engineering implementation
    - the metr
- Discoverability
    - once data has been defined and implemented, anyone in the company can find them

Need to overcome all three barriers to achieve effective communications
